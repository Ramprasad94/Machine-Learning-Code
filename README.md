1. Decision tree: Decision trees are one of the most popular learning algorithms around. For small to medium sized datasets with decent 
number of features, decision trees are a great way to fit the data and predict with decent accuracy. This implementation of decision tree
implements a multi-way split depending on the feature values. While this tree may overfit occasionally due to the multi-way split procedure, using bagging in combination is bound to give much better results.
